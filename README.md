# FullStkOpen0

My solutions for the tasks given in FullStack Open part 0. All of the tasks are contained in the same main branch of the repository
as separate **.MD** files named accordingly based on the tasks themselves. The diagrams in the tasks are made utilizing MermaidJS. I believe this was a good exercise for learning MermaidJS itself
and its syntax. I think it is interesting and I will definitely use it in the future as a tool to help me in my tasks.
